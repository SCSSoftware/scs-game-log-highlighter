SCS Game Log Highlighter
========================

A simple highlighter of SCS Software's game logs for Sublime Text (3). It mainly highlights warnings and errors (and debug info for example), but also improves overall readability of the log.


Installation and Usage:
-----------------------
Place the files in the `Packages/User` folder and restart Sublime Text.

The syntax highlight will be chosen automatically. If not, you can find it under "User -> SCS game log".


Notes:
--------
Currently the highlight is supported only for the Monokai theme. If you want to adjust the colors, you can change them in the "Monokai.sublime-color-scheme" file (variables).
